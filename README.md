This is my final project for 5340 where I created my own application for this class. I created a TaskManager application to help users manager their tasks more effectively. 
( I have updated this app to also include the Firebase Authentication, and Firestore Database) 
There is now a Sign In/Sign Up page that you have to go through before entering the app. 
When you enter it will take you to the main screen where you can view all of your tasks, on the main screen you will be able to as well add a new task, or sign out.
When clicking on a task you will be able to view and at the top right be able to trash it. 
If you are on the screen viewing all the tasks swiping on it will toggle completion of the task created.
The final product is below:
